# ieor4630_final

Code for final project. Structure is as follows:
1. data: selects data from WRDS database
2. portfolio: manages the cash-flow based portfolio. Allows for assets to be traded based on their ticker and calculates portfolio returns
3. strategy: contains code for the creation of each strategy: naive, markowitz, and risk-parity.

See the jupyter notebook named "backtests.ipynb" for the implementation and results of each strategy.
